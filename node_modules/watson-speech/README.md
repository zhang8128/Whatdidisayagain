IBM Watson Speech Services for Web Browsers
===========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk)
[![npm-version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/watson-speech.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-speech)

Allows you to easily add voice recognition and synthesis to any web app with minimal code.

### Build for Browsers
This library is primarily intended for use in web browsers.
Check out [watson-developer-cloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-developer-cloud) to use Watson services (speech and others) from Node.js.

However, a server-side component is required to generate auth tokens. 
The examples/ folder includes example Node.js and Python servers, and SDKs are available for [Node.js](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk#authorization), 
[Java](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk), 
[Python](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk/blob/v0.30.1/examples/authorization_v1.py), 
and there is also a [REST API](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/gs-tokens.shtml).


### Installation - standalone

Pre-compiled bundles are available from on GitHub Releases - just download the file and drop it into your website: https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk/releases


### Installation - npm with browserify

This library is built with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and easy to use in browserify-based projects :

    npm install --save watson-speech

Breaking change for v0.22.0
----------------------------

The format of objects emitted in objectMode has changed from `{alternatives: [...], index: 1}` to `{results: [{alternatives: [...]}], result_index: 1}`.
This was done to enable the new `speaker_labels` feature.
There is a new `ResultExtractor` class and `recognizeMicrophone()` and `recognizeFile()` both accept a new `extract_results` option to restore the old behavior.

The format now exactly matches what the Watson Speech to Text service returns and shouldn't change again unless the Watson service changes.


API & Examples
--------------

The basic API is outlined below, see complete API docs at http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/

See several examples at https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk/tree/v0.30.1/examples/static/

All API methods require an auth token that must be [generated server-side](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk#authorization). 
(See https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk/tree/v0.30.1/examples/ for a couple of basic examples in Node.js and Python.)

## [`WatsonSpeech.TextToSpeech`](http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/module-watson-speech_text-to-speech.html)

### [`.synthesize({text, token})`](http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/module-watson-speech_text-to-speech_synthesize.html) -> `<audio>`

Speaks the supplied text through an automatically-created `<audio>` element. 
Currently limited to text that can fit within a GET URL (this is particularly an issue on [Internet Explorer before Windows 10](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32267442/url-length-limitation-of-microsoft-edge)
where the max length is around 1000 characters after the token is accounted for.)

Options: 
* text - the text to transcribe // todo: list supported languages
* voice - the desired playback voice's name - see .getVoices(). Note that the voices are language-specific.
* autoPlay - set to false to prevent the audio from automatically playing


## [`WatsonSpeech.SpeechToText`](http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/module-watson-speech_speech-to-text.html)


### [`.recognizeMicrophone({token})`](http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/module-watson-speech_speech-to-text_recognize-microphone.html) -> Stream

Options: 
* `keepMic`: if true, preserves the MicrophoneStream for subsequent calls, preventing additional permissions requests in Firefox
* Other options passed to [RecognizeStream]
* Other options passed to [WritableElementStream] if `options.outputElement` is set

Requires the `getUserMedia` API, so limited browser compatibility (see http://caniuse.com/#search=getusermedia) 
Also note that Chrome requires https (with a few exceptions for localhost and such) - see https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features

Pipes results through a [FormatStream] by default, set `options.format=false` to disable.


### [`.recognizeFile({data, token})`](http://watson-developer-cloud.github.io/speech-javascript-sdk/v0.30.1/module-watson-speech_speech-to-text_recognize-file.html) -> Stream

Can recognize and optionally attempt to play a [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) or [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)
(such as from an `<input type="file"/>` or from an ajax request.)

Options: 
* `file`: a String URL or a `Blob` or `File` instance.
* `play`: (optional, default=`false`) Attempt to also play the file locally while uploading it for transcription 
* Other options passed to [RecognizeStream]
* Other options passed to [WritableElementStream] if `options.outputElement` is set

`play`requires that the browser support the format; most browsers support wav and ogg/opus, but not flac.) 
Will emit an `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` error on the RecognizeStream if playback fails.
Playback will automatically stop when `.stop()` is called on the returned stream.
For Mobile Safari compatibility, a URL must be provided, and `recognizeFile()` must be called in direct response to a user interaction (so the token must be pre-loaded).

Pipes results through a [TimingStream] by if `options.play=true`, set `options.realtime=false` to disable.

Pipes results through a [FormatStream] by default, set `options.format=false` to disable.


## Changes

There have been a few breaking changes in recent releases:

* Removed `SpeechToText.recognizeElement()` due to quality issues
* renamed `recognizeBlob` to `recognizeFile` to make the primary usage more apparent
* Changed `playFile` option of `recognizeBlob()` to just `play`, corrected default
* Changed format of objects emitted in objectMode to exactly match what service sends. Added `ResultStrean` class and `extract_results` option to enable older behavior.
* Changed `playback-error` event to just `error` when recognizing and playing a file. Check for `error.name == 'UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT'` to identify playback errors
* Renamed `recognizeFile()`'s `data` option to `file` because it now may be a URL. Using a URL enables faster playback and mobile Safari support

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

## todo

* Further solidify API
* break components into standalone npm modules where it makes sense
* run integration tests on travis (fall back to offline server for pull requests)
* add even more tests
* better cross-browser testing (IE, Safari, mobile browsers - maybe saucelabs?)
* update node-sdk to use current version of this lib's RecognizeStream (and also provide the FormatStream + anything else that might be handy)
* move `result` and `results` events to node wrapper (along with the deprecation notice)
* improve docs
* consider a wrapper to match https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html
* support a "hard" stop that prevents any further data events, even for already uploaded audio, ensure timing stream also implements this.
* look for bug where single-word final results may omit word confidence (possibly due to FormatStream?)
* fix bug where TimingStream shows words slightly before they're spoken
